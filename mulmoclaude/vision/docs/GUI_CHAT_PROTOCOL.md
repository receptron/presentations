# GUI Chat Protocol

## Overview

GUI Chat Protocol is a natural extension of existing tool calling mechanisms (like function calling and MCP - Model Context Protocol) that enables GUI and multi-modal interactions in LLM chat interfaces. While traditional LLM chat has been constrained to text-based input and output, GUI Chat Protocol bridges the gap between conversational AI and rich graphical user interfaces.

## Motivation

Conversational AI has traditionally operated in a text-only paradigm:
- User sends text
- LLM responds with text
- Interaction is linear and lacks visual context

However, many real-world use cases benefit from visual and interactive elements:
- Displaying generated images or edited photos
- Showing maps and geographic data
- Presenting interactive games or quizzes
- Rendering rich media like music players or podcasts
- Visualizing data through charts and graphs

GUI Chat Protocol addresses this limitation by leveraging the existing tool calling infrastructure to trigger GUI components and multi-modal content.

## Core Concept

From the LLM's perspective, GUI Chat Protocol looks identical to standard function calling. The LLM:
1. Receives tool definitions in its system prompt
2. Decides when to invoke a tool based on user conversation
3. Calls the tool with appropriate arguments (standard JSON)
4. Receives the execution result as text

**The key difference**: Instead of the tool result being purely textual data displayed inline, it triggers the rendering of a GUI component or multi-modal content in the chat interface.

## How It Works

### Enhanced Tool Calls

GUI Chat Protocol is **not a new architecture**—it's a simple enhancement to existing tool call mechanisms. The difference is subtle but powerful:

**Traditional Tool Call:**
```
Tool executes → Returns text/data to LLM → LLM incorporates it in response
```

**Enhanced Tool Call (GUI Chat Protocol):**
```
Tool executes → Returns data to LLM + additional typed data for GUI →
  - LLM receives text response (continues conversation normally)
  - UI receives typed data (renders appropriate visual component)
```

### The Enhancement: Typed Return Data

When a tool executes, it returns a `ToolResult` with two relevant payloads:

1. **LLM response fields** – `message` (required) and optional `jsonData` that the LLM consumes to continue the conversation
2. **GUI payload** – `data`, a structured object tagged with a `type` identifier (e.g., `"image"`, `"map"`, `"game"`)

Optional `instructions`, `title`, `action`, and `updating` fields help the LLM or UI understand how to follow up. `action` carries the sub-action verb the tool was invoked with (e.g. `"openApp"`, `"addEntry"`), letting hosts label multi-feature tool results in the UI without inspecting the call args.

The **type** within `ToolResult.data` determines which visual component renders it:

- Type `"image"` → Image viewer component
- Type `"map"` → Map component
- Type `"browse"` → Web content viewer
- Type `"game"` → Game board component
- Type `"music"` → Music player component

Each type is associated with:
- **View component**: Full-size interactive display for the main canvas
- **Preview component**: Compact thumbnail for the sidebar/chat history

### Why This Makes Adoption Easy

Because this is just an enhancement to existing tool calls, chat applications like ChatGPT can easily add GUI capabilities:

1. **Keep existing tools unchanged**: Current text-based tools continue to work
2. **Add typed return data**: Enhance specific tools to return additional GUI data
3. **Register view/preview components**: Map each data type to a rendering component
4. **No LLM changes needed**: The LLM still just calls functions and gets text responses

The flow remains standard: tool results are always sent back to the LLM as function outputs (never displayed directly to the user). The enhancement is that when a tool result includes typed GUI data, the chat interface additionally renders the appropriate visual component alongside the conversation.

### Examples

**Image Generation Tool:**
```javascript
// Tool executes
const result = await generateImage(prompt);

// Return ToolResult
return {
  message: "I've generated an image based on your prompt.",
  jsonData: { prompt, imageUrl: result.imageUrl },

  data: {
    type: "image",
    url: result.imageUrl,
    prompt: prompt,
    dimensions: { width: 1024, height: 1024 }
  }
};
```

**Map Tool:**
```javascript
// Tool executes
const location = await geocode(address);

// Return ToolResult
return {
  message: `Found location: ${location.name} at coordinates (${location.lat}, ${location.lng})`,
  jsonData: location,

  data: {
    type: "map",
    center: { lat: location.lat, lng: location.lng },
    zoom: 15,
    markers: [{ position: location, label: location.name }]
  }
};
```

The LLM sees only the text response. The UI receives the typed data and renders the map component.

### Bidirectional Interaction

GUI Chat Protocol is not just about displaying output—it's also about collecting structured input from users. Tools can be designed to gather user input through GUI forms, which are then sent back to the LLM as structured data.

**Form Input Tool:**
```javascript
// LLM calls presentForm to collect recipe preferences
presentForm({
  title: "Recipe Preferences",
  fields: [
    { id: "dish", type: "text", label: "What dish do you want to cook?", required: true },
    { id: "servings", type: "number", label: "Number of servings", defaultValue: 4 },
    { id: "skillLevel", type: "radio", label: "Your cooking experience",
      choices: ["Beginner", "Intermediate", "Advanced"], required: true },
    { id: "time", type: "dropdown", label: "Available time",
      choices: ["15 min", "30 min", "1 hour", "2 hours"], required: true },
    { id: "dietary", type: "textarea", label: "Dietary restrictions", required: false }
  ]
});

// Return ToolResult
return {
  message: "Form created with 5 fields: Recipe Preferences",

  data: {
    type: "form",
    title: "Recipe Preferences",
    fields: [/* field definitions */]
  },

  instructions: "Wait for the user to fill out and submit the form. They will send responses as JSON."
};

// User fills out the form in GUI and clicks submit
// The form component sends the responses back as a text message:
```

**When user submits the form, it's sent to the LLM as a text JSON message:**
```json
{
  "formSubmission": {
    "formTitle": "Recipe Preferences",
    "responses": {
      "dish": "Spaghetti Carbonara",
      "servings": 4,
      "skillLevel": "Intermediate",
      "time": "1 hour",
      "dietary": "No dairy"
    }
  }
}
```

The LLM receives this as regular user input and can parse the JSON to process the form data.

**Document Presentation Tool:**
```javascript
// After receiving form data, LLM creates a recipe document
presentDocument({
  title: "Spaghetti Carbonara Recipe",
  markdown: `
# Spaghetti Carbonara

![A plate of creamy spaghetti carbonara](__too_be_replaced_image_path__)

## Ingredients (4 servings)
- 400g spaghetti
- 200g pancetta
- 4 eggs
...

## Instructions

### Step 1: Boil the pasta
![Pasta boiling in a large pot](__too_be_replaced_image_path__)

Cook spaghetti in salted water...
  `
});

// Return ToolResult
return {
  message: "Created markdown document: Spaghetti Carbonara Recipe",

  data: {
    type: "document",
    markdown: "# Spaghetti Carbonara\n\n![...](generated-image-url.png)..." // with images generated
  },

  instructions: "Acknowledge that the document has been created and is displayed to the user."
};
```

This bidirectional capability enables workflows like:
1. **Guided tutorials**: Collect user skill level → present appropriate content
2. **Form-based interactions**: Gather structured input → process and display results
3. **Interactive applications**: User submits form → LLM analyzes → displays visualization

The key insight: GUI components can both **present information to** and **collect information from** users, all through the same enhanced tool call mechanism.

## LLM Agnostic Design

Because GUI Chat Protocol builds on standard tool calling, it works with any LLM that supports function calling:

- **OpenAI GPT models**: Uses native function calling
- **Anthropic Claude**: Uses tool use feature
- **Google Gemini**: Uses function declarations
- **Open-weight models**: Any model supporting tool calling (Llama, Mistral, etc.)

The protocol is **model-agnostic** because:
1. Tool definitions use standard JSON Schema
2. Tool invocation follows standard patterns
3. Results are returned as structured JSON
4. No special model capabilities required beyond basic function calling

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Richer interactions**: Visual and interactive content alongside conversation
- **Multi-modal experiences**: Images, maps, games, media players in chat
- **Contextual UI**: Relevant components appear automatically based on conversation

### For Developers
- **Reusable plugins**: Each capability is self-contained and composable
- **Standard integration**: Works with any function-calling-capable LLM
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new tools without changing core chat logic
- **Separation of concerns**: Plugin logic, UI rendering, and chat management are decoupled

### For AI Applications
- **Beyond text chat**: Enables new categories of AI applications
- **Voice + GUI**: Combines conversational AI (including voice) with visual interfaces
- **Agentic workflows**: Tools can chain together with visual feedback at each step

## Use Cases

1. **Creative Tools**: AI generates images, edits photos, composes music
2. **Information Discovery**: AI searches web, displays maps, shows data visualizations
3. **Interactive Learning**: AI creates quizzes, plays games, provides visual explanations
4. **Content Creation**: AI helps create podcasts, videos, presentations with live previews
5. **Productivity**: AI performs tasks with rich feedback (calendar views, document previews, etc.)

## Composable Roles Without Code

One of the most powerful aspects of GUI Chat Protocol is the ability to create specialized AI assistants—called **roles**—**without writing any custom code**. Roles are different behavioral modes of the same chat application, each defined purely by composing existing tools with a system prompt.

### What is a Role?

A **role** is a complete AI application defined by just two things:
1. **Available tools**: Which tools the LLM can call
2. **System prompt**: Instructions describing the role's behavior, personality, and workflow

That's it. No custom code, components, or logic required. The same generic chat interface becomes a completely different application simply by changing its role.

### Example: Recipe Guide Role

The Recipe Guide role is defined purely through configuration:

**Available Tools:**
- `presentForm` - Collect cooking preferences from user
- `presentDocument` - Display recipe with embedded images
- `generateImage` - Generate step-by-step cooking images
- `browse` - Look up recipes online
- `searchWeb` - Search for cooking techniques
- `scrollToAnchor` - Navigate to specific recipe steps

**System Prompt:**
```
You are an expert cooking instructor who guides users through recipes step-by-step.

1. GREETING: Warmly welcome the user
2. COLLECT REQUIREMENTS: Create a form asking for dish name, servings, skill level, time
3. CREATE RECIPE: Use presentDocument to show ingredients, equipment, and numbered steps
   with embedded images
4. HANDS-FREE ASSISTANCE: When asked to read a step, call scrollToAnchor then speak it aloud
```

That's it! No custom code required. The same generic chat application operating in different roles:
- **Trip Planner role**: `presentForm` + `presentDocument` + `map` + `browse`
- **Clinic Receptionist role**: `presentForm` + `presentDocument` + `takePhoto`
- **Tutor role**: `putQuestions` + `presentDocument` + `generateImage` + `presentForm`
- **Weather Reporter role**: `presentForm` + `fetchWeather` + `showPresentation` + `generateImage`
- **Game Companion role**: `playOthello` + `playGo` + `putQuestions` + `generateHtml`
- **Office Assistant role**: `presentDocument` + `presentSpreadsheet` + `showPresentation`

### The Power of Role Composition

Each role is simply:
1. **Tool Selection**: Choose which tools to enable from the available set
2. **System Prompt**: Describe the behavior, workflow, and personality
3. **No Code**: The generic GUI Chat Protocol infrastructure handles everything else

This role-based architecture enables:
- **Rapid prototyping**: Create new AI applications in minutes by defining a new role
- **Easy customization**: Change behavior by editing text configuration, not code
- **Modular tools**: Same tools work across different roles
- **User empowerment**: Non-programmers can create specialized AI assistants
- **Role switching**: LLM or user can switch between roles dynamically (see below)

The chat application itself is **completely generic**—it just knows how to:
- Execute tools and display their typed GUI data
- Send user inputs (text, form submissions) to the LLM
- Render view/preview components for each data type

All application-specific logic lives in the **role definition** (system prompt + tool selection), not in custom application code. The role IS the application.

### Dynamic Role Switching

Because roles are just configuration data, the LLM can **switch between applications dynamically** via a function call:

```javascript
// The LLM can call switchRole to change its behavior
switchRole({ role: "recipeGuide" })
// → Reconnects with Recipe Guide's tools and system prompt

switchRole({ role: "tutor" })
// → Reconnects as an adaptive tutor

switchRole({ role: "listener" })
// → Becomes a silent listener that only generates images
```

This enables **meta-level capabilities**:
- **Adaptive behavior**: LLM decides which role fits the user's needs
- **Seamless transitions**: User asks for trip planning → LLM switches to Trip Planner role
- **Multi-phase workflows**: Start as General assistant → switch to Tutor when teaching → switch to Game for practice
- **User-driven**: User can explicitly request role changes ("switch to recipe guide mode")

### Dynamic Role Creation (Potential)

Since roles are defined by data (tool list + system prompt), it's theoretically possible to:

1. **LLM generates new roles on-the-fly**:
   ```javascript
   createRole({
     name: "Fitness Coach",
     tools: ["presentForm", "presentDocument", "generateImage", "browse"],
     systemPrompt: "You are a fitness coach who creates personalized workout plans..."
   })
   ```

2. **User-customized roles**: User describes what they need → LLM designs a custom role with appropriate tools and prompt

3. **Role marketplace**: Share and download community-created roles

4. **Self-evolving applications**: LLM refines its own role definition based on user feedback

The key insight: **When application behavior is configuration rather than code, the application can modify itself programmatically**.

## Design Principles

### 1. Transparent to LLM
The LLM sees only function definitions and calls. It doesn't need to "know" that it's triggering GUI components.

### 2. Structured Results
Tool results follow consistent schemas, making them easy to render and update.

### 3. Conversational Integration
GUI components exist within the chat flow, not as separate windows or modes.

### 4. Stateful Updates
Some tools can update their previous results rather than creating new ones (e.g., game moves, iterative editing).

### 5. User Agency
Users can interact with GUI components directly, not just through LLM conversation.

## Future Directions

### Toward a Chat-Centric Operating System

GUI Chat Protocol has the potential to fundamentally transform how we interact with computers, devices, and operating systems. We envision a future where **conversational AI becomes the primary user interface**, replacing the traditional app-centric paradigm that has dominated computing for decades.

#### The App-Centric Paradigm (Current)

Today's operating systems are built around applications:
1. User has a goal (e.g., "plan a trip", "cook dinner", "learn Spanish")
2. User must **choose the right application** (Maps? Browser? Notes? Specialized travel app?)
3. User must **learn the application's interface** (menus, buttons, workflows)
4. User performs the task **within the constraints of that application**
5. Often requires **switching between multiple apps** to complete a single goal

This creates friction:
- Cognitive overhead of choosing the right app
- Learning curve for each application
- Context switching between apps
- Limited interoperability between apps
- Apps become outdated and unmaintained

#### The Chat-Centric Paradigm (Future)

Imagine an operating system where the primary interface is conversational:
1. User expresses intent in natural language (voice or text)
2. OS provides appropriate **tools** (capabilities) and assumes relevant **role** (behavior mode)
3. User accomplishes goal through **natural conversation + dynamic GUI**
4. No app launching, no interface learning, no context switching

**Example Workflow:**
```
User: "I want to plan a trip to Japan"
OS: [Switches to Trip Planner role, presents form to collect preferences]
User: [Fills out form: destination, dates, budget, interests]
OS: [Presents detailed itinerary document with maps, images, recommendations]
User: "Show me the hotel on a map"
OS: [Displays interactive map with hotel location]
User: "Now help me learn basic Japanese phrases"
OS: [Switches to Language Tutor role, creates interactive lesson]
```

No apps were launched. No interfaces were learned. Just natural conversation enhanced with dynamic, context-appropriate GUI.

#### Tools as Operating System Capabilities

Instead of **applications**, the OS provides **tools**:
- `presentForm` - Collect structured input from user
- `presentDocument` - Display rich documents with embedded media
- `map` - Show geographic information
- `browse` - Access web content
- `generateImage` - Create visual content
- `playMedia` - Audio/video playback
- `presentSpreadsheet` - Data manipulation and analysis
- `present3D` - 3D visualization
- `search` - Information retrieval
- `fileManagement` - File operations
- `calendar` - Time management
- ... and countless others

These tools are **composable primitives**—like system calls, but for AI. Any combination of tools can be orchestrated through conversation to accomplish any task.

#### Roles as Dynamic Behavioral Modes

Instead of launching different **applications**, the OS assumes different **roles**:
- Recipe Guide role (for cooking)
- Trip Planner role (for travel planning)
- Tutor role (for learning)
- Office Assistant role (for productivity tasks)
- Developer Assistant role (for programming)
- Health Coach role (for fitness and wellness)
- ... defined by users or created dynamically by the AI

Roles can:
- **Switch automatically** based on user intent
- **Be created on-the-fly** when needed
- **Evolve over time** based on user preferences
- **Be shared and downloaded** from a role marketplace

#### Benefits of Chat-Centric OS

**For Users:**
- **Zero learning curve**: Conversational interface is natural and intuitive
- **Unified experience**: Same interface for all tasks
- **Context preservation**: Conversation maintains context across tasks
- **Adaptive interface**: System learns and adapts to user's needs
- **Accessibility**: Natural language is more accessible than complex UIs

**For the Ecosystem:**
- **Eliminate app fragmentation**: No need for thousands of single-purpose apps
- **Continuous evolution**: Tools and roles can be updated independently
- **Composability**: Unlimited combinations of tools create unlimited capabilities
- **Reduced maintenance**: Tools are simpler than full applications
- **Innovation acceleration**: New capabilities added by creating tools, not entire apps

**For Developers:**
- **Build tools, not apps**: Focus on specific capabilities
- **Reusable components**: Tools work across all roles
- **No UI design burden**: GUI components are standardized
- **Instant distribution**: Tools available system-wide immediately

#### Technical Path Forward

To realize this vision:

1. **OS-level integration**: Chat interface as a core OS component (like Spotlight, Siri, or Windows Search, but far more capable)

2. **Standardized tool protocol**: Common specifications for tool definitions, execution, and GUI data schemas across platforms

3. **System tool registry**: OS maintains available tools, similar to how it manages system APIs

4. **Role definition format**: Standard format for defining roles (tools + system prompt + metadata)

5. **Security model**: Permission system for tools (like app permissions, but more granular)

6. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Same tools and roles work on desktop, mobile, wearables, IoT devices

7. **Component marketplace**: Ecosystem for sharing and discovering tools, roles, and view components

8. **Nested tool execution**: Tools that invoke other tools with visual feedback at each step

9. **Multi-user collaboration**: Shared sessions where multiple users interact with the same GUI components in real-time

10. **Context awareness**: OS provides environmental context (location, time, calendar, etc.) to enhance conversations

#### The Paradigm Shift

This represents a fundamental shift in human-computer interaction:

| Dimension | App-Centric OS | Chat-Centric OS |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Primary Interface** | Applications | Conversation + Dynamic GUI |
| **User Action** | Launch app, navigate UI | Express intent in natural language |
| **Software Units** | Applications | Tools + Roles |
| **Context Switching** | Constant (between apps) | Minimal (within conversation) |
| **Learning Curve** | Per application | One-time (conversational) |
| **Interoperability** | Limited (via APIs) | Native (all tools composable) |
| **Customization** | Per-app settings | Role creation/modification |
| **Discovery** | App stores, search | Natural conversation |

#### Toward Natural Computing

The chat-centric OS paradigm aligns computing with how humans naturally think and communicate:
- We express **goals**, not implementation steps
- We **converse** to clarify and refine
- We **compose** capabilities as needed
- We **adapt** our approach based on context

GUI Chat Protocol provides the foundation for this future—a future where computers understand what we want and dynamically assemble the right tools, interfaces, and behaviors to help us accomplish it. Not through rigid applications, but through fluid, adaptive, conversational interaction.

**The operating system becomes a conversational partner, not a collection of apps.**

## Plugin Runtime API (v0.3+)

`gui-chat-protocol@0.3.0` adds an opt-in factory-shape plugin contract that gives plugins a host-constructed, per-plugin scoped runtime (`pubsub`, `files.{data,config}`, `log`, `fetch`, `locale`, `dispatch`). See [`PLUGIN_RUNTIME.md`](./PLUGIN_RUNTIME.md) for the contract, the type surface, the path-normalisation rules, and the recommended ESLint preset.

The legacy `(context, args)` shape covered in [`CREATING_A_PLUGIN.md`](./CREATING_A_PLUGIN.md) continues to work without changes. The factory shape is the recommended form for new plugins.

## Conclusion

GUI Chat Protocol represents a paradigm shift from text-only to multi-modal conversational AI. By leveraging existing tool calling infrastructure and adding a visual rendering layer, it enables LLMs to produce rich, interactive experiences while remaining compatible with all major language models.

The future of AI chat is not just better text responses—it's intelligent systems that can seamlessly blend conversation with visual, interactive, and multi-modal content. GUI Chat Protocol provides a foundation for building these next-generation AI applications.
